# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

## For example,
## Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
## The longest consecutive elements sequence is [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]. Return its length: 4.

## Input: type Array - sequence of integers
## Output: type Integer - represents the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence

arr = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

def longest_consecutive_sequence_brute_force(nums)
  nums.sort! # nlog(n)

  current_length = 1 #Could be a issue with scopes
  max_length = 0

  nums.each_with_index do | current_num, i|  # Time: O(n)
    next_num = nums[i + 1]

    next if next_num == nil 

    if current_num == next_num - 1
      current_length = current_length + 1 
    end
    # if current_length > max_length 
    #   max_length = current_length
    # end
    max_length = [max_length, current_length].max #ðŸ§¼
  end    

  max_length

## Key Take Aways:
## Learned Pointers (indexes), Standard Code Practices
## New Ruby Methods: Array.each_with_index, Array.sort!
## Building on fundamentals conditionals, comparison operators,  Loops (with indexes)
## Advanced Concepts: Guard Clauses
